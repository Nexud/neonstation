      Los Lobos (pronounced [los ˈloβos], Spanish for "the Wolves") is an American rock band from East Los Angeles, California, United States. Their music is influenced by rock and roll, Tex-Mex, country, zydeco, folk, R&amp;B, blues, brown-eyed soul, and traditional music such as cumbia, boleros and norteños. It gained international stardom in 1987, when their cover version of Ritchie Valens' "La Bamba" topped the charts in the U.S., the UK and several other countries.

      Kiko and the lavender moon<br>
      Out playing, makes believe<br>
      Nobody can see<br>
      And then he waits<br>
      And then he fakes<br>
      And then he bends<br>
      And then he shakes<br>
      He plays and plays<br>
      Still playing till he<br>
      Goes off to sleep<br>
      <br>
      Kiko and the lavender moon<br>
      Out dancing making faces at<br>
      A big black cat<br>
      And then he flies<br>
      Up to the wall<br>
      Stands on one foot<br>
      Doesn't even fall<br>
      Dance and dance<br>
      Still dancing till<br>
      He goes off to sleep<br>
      <br>
      He always sleeps<br>
      Till the sun goes down<br>
      He never wakes<br>
      Till no one's around<br>
      He never stops<br>
      Can't catch his breath<br>
      It's always there<br>
      Scares him to death<br>
      <br>
      Kiko and the lavender moon<br>
      Out dreaming 'bout green shoes<br>
      Haircuts and cake<br>
      And then he wishes<br>
      The world away<br>
      And then he kneels<br>
      As if to pray<br>
      He dreams and dreams<br>
      Kiko and the lavender moon
