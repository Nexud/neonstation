      Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 â€“ June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a "horn-like" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.
      <br><br>
      After tumultuous teenage years, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra, performing across the country, but most often associated with the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. Fitzgerald's rendition of the nursery rhyme "A-Tisket, A-Tasket" helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start a solo career that would last effectively the rest of her life.

      Signed with manager and Savoy co-founder Moe Gale from early in her career, she eventually gave managerial control for her performance and recording career to Norman Granz, who built up the label Verve Records based in part on Fitzgerald's vocal abilities. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretation of the Great American Songbook.

    <div class="selected-song-lyrics">
      I'm feeling mighty lonesome<br>
      Haven't slept a wink<br>
      I walk the floor and watch the door<br>
      And in between I drink<br>
      Black Coffee<br>
      Love's a hand me down brew<br>
      I'll never know a Sunday<br>
      In this weekday room<br>
      <br>
      I'm talking to the shadows<br>
      1 o'clock to 4<br>
      And Lord, how slow the moments go<br>
      When all I do is pour<br>
      Black Coffee<br>
      Since the blues caught my eye<br>
      I'm hanging out on Monday<br>
      My Sunday dream's too dry<br>
      <br>
      Now a man is born to go a lovin'<br>
      A woman's born to weep and fret<br>
      To stay at home and tend her oven<br>
      And drown her past regrets<br>
      In coffee and cigarettes<br>
      <br>
      I'm moody all the morning<br>
      Mourning all the night<br>
      And in between it's nicotine<br>
      And not much hard to fight<br>
      Black Coffee<br>
      Feelin' low as the ground<br>
      It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby<br>
      To maybe come around<br>
      <br>
      My nerves have gone to pieces<br>
      My hair is turning gray<br>
      All I do is drink black coffee<br>
      Since my man's gone away
