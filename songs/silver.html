    <div class="selected-song-lyrics">
      Drawn to the violence of change<br>
      Charmed by the sentimental brave<br>
      I hear the door slam I look the other way<br>
      I hate the small talk and the empty days<br>
      <br>
      Silver lining, I bathe in your light<br>
      I'll always believe in your place in my life<br>
      Silver lining, I know that I'm right<br>
      I'll always believe in your right to shine<br>
      <br>
      Scared of the things that people say<br>
      Knowing my confidence might fail<br>
      I feel the worlds weight upon my breaking back<br>
      I see uncertainty and the visible cracks<br>
      <br>
      Silver lining, I bathe in your light<br>
      I'll always believe in your place in my life<br>
      Silver lining, I know that I'm right<br>
      I'll always believe in your right to shine<br>
      <br>
      Silver lining, I bathe in your light<br>
      I'll always believe in your place in my life<br>
      Silver lining, I know that I'm right<br>
      I'll always believe in your right to shine
