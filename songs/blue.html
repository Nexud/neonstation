      Blue moon<br>
      You saw me standing alone<br>
      Without a dream in my heart<br>
      Without a love of my own<br>
      Blue moon<br>
      You know just what I was there for<br>
      You heard me saying a prayer for<br>
      Someone I really could care for<br>
      <br>
      And then there suddenly appeared before me<br>
      The only one my arms will hold<br>
      I heard somebody whisper please adore me<br>
      And when I looked to the Moon it turned to gold<br>
      <br>
      Blue moon<br>
      Now I'm no longer alone<br>
      Without a dream in my heart<br>
      Without a love of my own<br>
      <br>
      And then there suddenly appeared before me<br>
      The only one my arms will ever hold<br>
      I heard somebody whisper please adore me<br>
      And when I looked the Moon had turned to gold<br>
      <br>
      Blue moon<br>
      Now I'm no longer alone<br>
      Without a dream in my heart<br>
      Without a love of my own<br>
      <br>
      Blue moon<br>
      Now I'm no longer alone<br>
      Without a dream in my heart<br>
      Without a love of my own
