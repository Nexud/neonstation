      Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. The band have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.[5]

      Fleetwood Mac were founded by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Jeremy Spencer. They lacked a permanent bass guitarist for the first few months before Green convinced John McVie to join, establishing the first stable line-up in time to record their self-titled debut album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third guitarist in 1969, and keyboardist Christine Perfect, who was used as a session musician starting with the second album, later married John McVie and joined the band in 1970. During this time period, the band was primarily a British blues outfit, scoring a UK number one with "Albatross";[6] and had lesser hits with the singles "Oh Well" and "Black Magic Woman". Personal problems led to original guitarists Green and Spencer leaving in short order, replaced by Bob Welch and Bob Weston.

      You look at me with those brown eyes<br>
      What do you want to do?<br>
      Do you have to have me<br>
      The way that I want you? I want you<br>
      <br>
      Sha-la-lah<br>
      <br>
      When you look at me with those brown eyes<br>
      What do you want to say?<br>
      And are you just another liar?<br>
      Will you take me all the way? All the way?<br>
      <br>
      Sha-la-lah
