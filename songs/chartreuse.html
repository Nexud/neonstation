      You're a freckled gal<br>
      You're a pug-nosed cutey, sweet as Charlotte Russe<br>
      You've got big blue eyes<br>
      So I ask you why have you dyed your hair chartreuse?<br>
      <br>
      Chartreuse (chartreuse)<br>
      Chartreuse (chartreuse)<br>
      Though you think it's mighty cute<br>
      Just wait 'til I write and tell your ma<br>
      That you dyed your hair chartreuse<br>
      (Repeat)<br>
      <br>
      In the days of old<br>
      When the knights were bolder and the girls were truer blue<br>
      Just think what paw<br>
      Would have said to maw had she dyed her hair chartreuse<br>
      Chartreuse (chartreuse)<br>
      Chartreuse (chartreuse)<br>
      Though you think it's mighty cute<br>
      You went too far in that beauty booth<br>
      When you dyed your hair chartreuse<br>
      <br>
      Now you know I know<br>
      That your hair was black when we lived on Chestnut Street<br>
      When you wore pigtails<br>
      And ginger ale was your most favourite treat<br>
      You're a big girl now<br>
      So you think it's cuter being fast and fancy-loose<br>
      But you went too far in that beauty booth<br>
      When you dyed your hair chartreuse<br>
      <br>
      Chartreuse (chartreuse)<br>
      Chartreuse (chartreuse)<br>
      Though you think it's mighty cute<br>
      Just wait 'til I write and tell your ma<br>
      That you dyed your hair chartreuse<br>
      Chartreuse (chartreuse)<br>
      Chartreuse (chartreuse)<br>
      Though you think it's mighty cute<br>
      But just wait 'til I write and tell your ma<br>
      You didn't like black, you didn't like red<br>
      You hated blondes, well, it's no use<br>
      You got mad and dyed your hair...<br>
      Chartreuse
