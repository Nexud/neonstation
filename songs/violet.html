      If there's a way that you could<br>
      be everything you want to be,<br>
      Would you complain that it came too easy?<br>
      Just like the games with you and me<br>
      A resolution hard to see,<br>
      But that's O.K. 'cause I don't<br>
      see things that are plain to see<br>
      I've got a dream to take you over<br>
      Exploding like a supernova<br>
      I'm gonna crash into your world<br>
      And that's no lie<br>
      <br>
      You want to give ecstacy delivered<br>
      with certainty<br>
      But you're afraid that the pleasure<br>
      won't be needed<br>
      In a way, we're the same two people<br>
      looking out to sea<br>
      For a wave that would carry all our fantasies<br>
      <br>
      If there's a way to infiltrate you<br>
      Sway your mind and complicate you<br>
      I'm gonna crash into your world<br>
      And that's no lie<br>
      <br>
      Let your body move into the doorway<br>
      To the disco inside your head (Violet)<br>
      Wear a color that you want to cling to<br>
      The color inside your head (Violet)<br>
      <br>
      Contemplate jealously intermixed<br>
      with urgency<br>
      A million things take a damned<br>
      good shot at you and me<br>
      <br>
      If there's a way to infiltrate you<br>
      Sway your mind and complicate you<br>
      I'm gonna crash into your world<br>
      And that's no lie<br>
      <br>
      Let your body move into the doorway<br>
      To the disco inside your head (Violet)<br>
      Wear a color that you want to cling to<br>
      The color inside your head (Violet)<br>
      <br>
      Dance to the disco, Dance to the disco<br>
      Dance to the disco, Dance to the disco<br>
      <br>
      I'm gonna take you<br>
      I'll do my best to break you<br>
      I'm gonna take you higher<br>
      And that's no lie<br>
      <br>
      Common sense is a game many<br>
      people don't like to play<br>
      But give it in and the moment takes<br>
      you either way<br>
      <br>
      I've got a dream to take you over<br>
      Exploding like a supernova<br>
      I'm gonna crash into your world<br>
      And that's no lie<br>
      <br>
      Let your body move into the doorway<br>
      To the disco inside your head (Violet)<br>
      Wear a color that you want to cling to<br>
      The color inside your head (Violet)<br>
      <br>
      If there's a way that you could<br>
      be everything you want to be,<br>
      Would you complain that it came too easy?<br>
