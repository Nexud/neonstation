      Nena is the stage name of German singer and actress Gabriele Susanne Kerner (born 24 March 1960 in Hagen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany). Nena was also the name of the band with whom she released the 1984 English recording of her most well-known song "99 Red Balloons" (orginally released in Germany in 1983 as "99 Luftballons").
      <br><br>
      Nena acquired her nickname, which means "baby girl" in Spanish, at the age of 3 during a vacation to Spain. Her first band was called The Stripes (1979). They had a very minor hit with the song "Ecstasy", but never managed to achieve broad success.
      <br><br>
      The band Nena was formed with Nena (singer), Rolf Brendel (drums), Carlo Karges (guitar), Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen (keyboard) and Jürgen Dehmel (bass) in Berlin in 1981. Their first hit single, "Nur geträumt" ("Only In Dreams"), came in 1982 after appearing on the German television program Musikladen.

      You and I in a little toy shop<br>
      Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got<br>
      Set them free at the break of dawn<br>
      'til one by one they were gone<br>
      Back at base bugs in the software<br>
      Flash the message: "something's out there!"<br>
      Floating in the summer sky<br>
      Ninety-nine red balloons go by<br>
      <br>
      Ninety-nine red balloons<br>
      Floating in the summer sky<br>
      Panic bells, it's red alert<br>
      There's something here from somewhere else<br>
      The war machine springs to life<br>
      Opens up one eager eye<br>
      Focusing it on the sky<br>
      Where ninety-nine red balloons go by<br>
      <br>
      Ninety-nine decision street<br>
      Ninety-nine ministers meet<br>
      To worry, worry, super scurry<br>
      Call the troops out in a hurry<br>
      This is what we've waited for<br>
      This is it, boys, this is war<br>
      The president is on the line<br>
      As ninety-nine red balloons go by<br>
      <br>
      Ninety-nine knights of the air<br>
      Ride super high-tech jet fighters<br>
      Everyone's a super hero<br>
      Everyone's a captain kirk<br>
      With orders to identify<br>
      To clarify and classify<br>
      Scramble in the summer sky<br>
      Ninety-nine red balloons go by<br>
      <br>
      As ninety-nine red balloons go by<br>
      <br>
      Ninety-nine dreams I have had<br>
      In every one a red balloon<br>
      It's all over and I'm standing pretty<br>
      In this dust that was a city<br>
      If I could find a souvenir<br>
      Just to prove the world was here<br>
      And here is a red balloon<br>
      I think of you, and let it go
