      Joe Logan Diffie (born December 28, 1958) is an American country music singer. After working as a demo singer in the 1980s, he signed with Epic Records' Nashville division in 1990. Between then and 2004, Diffie charted 35 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, five of which peaked at No. 1: his debut release "Home", "If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)", "Third Rock from the Sun", "Pickup Man" (his longest-lasting No. 1, at four weeks) and "Bigger Than the Beatles". In addition to these singles, he has had 12 others reach the Top 10 and ten more others reach the Top 40 on the same chart. He has also co-written singles for Holly Dunn, Tim McGraw, and Jo Dee Messina, and has recorded with Mary Chapin Carpenter, George Jones, and Marty Stuart.

      Diffie released seven studio albums, a Christmas album and a greatest-hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through Monument Records, Broken Bow Records, and Rounder Records. Among his albums, 1993's Honky Tonk Attitude and 1994's Third Rock from the Sun are certified certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America; while 1992's Regular Joe and 1995's Life's So Funny are both certified gold. His most recent album, Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album, was released in late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a neotraditionalist country influence with a mix of novelty songs and ballads.

    <div class="selected-song-lyrics">
      They were farm kids way down in Dixie<br>
      Met in high school in the sixties<br>
      Everyone knew it was love from the start<br>
      One July, in the midnight hour<br>
      He climbed upon the water towe<br>
      Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart<br>
      <br>
      In John Deere green<br>
      On a hot summer night<br>
      He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"<br>
      In letters three-foot high<br>
      And the whole town said that he should have used red<br>
      But it looked good to Charlene<br>
      In John Deere green<br>
      <br>
      They settled down on eighty acres<br>
      Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes<br>
      They went together like a hand and a glove<br>
      On a clear day from their front yard<br>
      If you look and know what to look for<br>
      Off to the east you can still read his words of love<br>
      <br>
      In John Deere green<br>
      On a hot summer night<br>
      He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"<br>
      In letters three-foot high<br>
      And the whole town said the boy should have used red<br>
      But it looked good to Charlene<br>
      In John Deere green<br>
      <br>
      Now more than once the town has discovered<br>
      Painting over it ain't no use<br>
      There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it<br>
      The heart keeps showing through<br>
      <br>
      In John Deere green<br>
      On a hot summer night<br>
      He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"<br>
      In letters three-foot high<br>
      And the whole town said the fool should have used red<br>
      But it looked good to Charlene<br>
      In John Deere green<br>
      <br>
      Ah, paint it green boy<br>
      <br>
      In John Deere green<br>
      On a hot summer night<br>
      He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"<br>
      In letters three-foot high<br>
      And the whole town said the boy should have used red<br>
      But it looked good to Charlene<br>
      In John Deere green<br>
