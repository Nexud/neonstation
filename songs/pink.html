    <div class="selected-song-lyrics">
      Well now you may think I'm foolish<br>
      For the foolish things I do<br>
      You may wonder how come I love you<br>
      When you get on my nerves like you do<br>
      Well baby you know you bug me<br>
      There ain't no secret 'bout that<br>
      Well come on over here and hug me<br>
      Baby I'll spill the facts<br>
      Well honey it ain't your money<br>
      'Cause baby I got plenty of that<br>
      I love you for your pink Cadillac<br>
      Crushed velvet seats<br>
      Riding in the back<br>
      Oozing down the street<br>
      Waving to the girls<br>
      Feeling out of sight<br>
      Spending all my money<br>
      On a Saturday night<br>
      Honey I just wonder what you do there in the back<br>
      Of your pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      <br>
      Well now way back in the Bible<br>
      Temptations always come along<br>
      There's always somebody tempting<br>
      Somebody into doing something they know is wrong<br>
      Well they tempt you, man, with silver<br>
      And they tempt you, sir, with gold<br>
      And they tempt you with the pleasure<br>
      That the flesh does surely hold<br>
      They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple<br>
      But man I ain't going for that<br>
      I know it was her pink Cadillac<br>
      Crushed velvet seats<br>
      Riding in the back<br>
      Oozing down the street<br>
      Waving to the girls<br>
      Feeling out of sight<br>
      Spending all my money<br>
      On a Saturday night<br>
      Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back<br>
      Of your pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      <br>
      Now some folks say it's too big<br>
      And uses too much gas<br>
      Some folks say it's too old<br>
      And that it goes too fast<br>
      But my love is bigger than a Honda<br>
      Yeah, it's bigger than a Subaru<br>
      Hey man there's only one thing<br>
      And one car that will do<br>
      Anyway we don't have to drive it<br>
      Honey we can park it out in back<br>
      And have a party in your pink Cadillac<br>
      Crushed velvet seats<br>
      Riding in the back<br>
      Oozing down the street<br>
      Waving to the girls<br>
      Feeling out of sight<br>
      Spending all my money on a Saturday night<br>
      Honey I just wonder what you do there in the back<br>
      Of your pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac<br>
      Pink Cadillac
