      The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British stage and television actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.

      For the first few months of their initial five-year career as "the Monkees", the four actor-musicians were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio. This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series.[1] Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. They eventually fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. The sitcom was canceled in 1968, but the band continued to record music through 1971.

      When the world and I were young<br>
      Just yesterday<br>
      Live was such a simple game<br>
      A child could play<br>
      It was easy then to tell right from wrong<br>
      Easy then to tell weak from strong<br>
      When a man should stand and fight<br>
      Or just go along<br>
      <br>
      But today there is no day or night<br>
      Today there is no dark or light<br>
      Today there is no black or white<br>
      Only shades of gray<br>
      <br>
      I remember when the answers seemed so clear<br>
      We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear<br>
      It was easy then to tell truth from lies<br>
      Selling out from compromise<br>
      Who to love and who to hate<br>
      The foolish from the wise<br>
      <br>
      But today there is no day or night<br>
      Today there is no dark or light<br>
      Today there is no black or white<br>
      Only shades of gray<br>
      <br>
      It was easy then to know what was fair<br>
      When to keep and when to share<br>
      How much to protect your heart<br>
      And how much to care<br>
      <br>
      But today there is no day or night<br>
      Today there is no dark or light<br>
      Today there is no black or white<br>
      Only shades of gray<br>
      Only shades of gray
