      The retro-swing unit Indigo Swing were formed in San Francisco around the sextet of vocalist Johnny Boyd, guitarist Josh Workman, bassist Vance Ehlers, drummer "Big Jim" Overton, pianist William Beatty and saxophone player Baron Shul. After kick-starting northern California's new school of swing, the group began touring around America and signed to Time Bomb Recordings in 1997. The group's debut All Aboard! was released in July 1998. They followed with Red Light in 1999.

      If you find you've been neglectin'<br>
      That someone you call your own<br>
      And your phone calls aren't connectin'<br>
      When you know she should be home<br>
      Brother, you gotta stop your ramblin'<br>
      She can't love a rollin' stone<br>
      What she really cares about<br>
      Is that she's all alone<br>
      <br>
      Swing Lover every night<br>
      Swing Lover holdin' me tight<br>
      Swing Lover nice and polite<br>
      It took 15 hours just to kiss me goodnight<br>
      <br>
      Swing Lover every day<br>
      Swing Lover take it away<br>
      Swing Lover ready to play<br>
      It took 15 hours just to I'm ok<br>
      <br>
      Won't you leave it uptown?<br>
      Won't you turn down the dial?<br>
      Stay at home with your baby, alone<br>
      Try to be still every once in a while<br>
      <br>
      Swing Lover give it to?<br>
      Swing Lover holdin' me close<br>
      Swing Lover don't wanna boast<br>
      It took 15 hours just to say I'm the most<br>
      <br>
      Oh, Won't you leave it uptown?<br>
      Won't you turn down the dial?<br>
      Stay at home with your baby, alone<br>
      Try to be still every once in a while<br>
      <br>
      Swing Lover every night<br>
      Swing Lover holdin' me tight<br>
      Swing Lover don't wanna fight<br>
      It took 15 hours just to kiss me goodnight
